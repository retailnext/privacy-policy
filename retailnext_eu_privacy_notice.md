This supplemental policy describes the personal information we collect about individuals ("you") on our own websites when you visit or provide information to us. We process your data according to the rules of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Refer to the full notice for complete details of our data processing activities.

#### Data Retention

It is our policy to limit the retention of personal data we collect as long as it is necessary for the purposes stated in this notice.

#### Data Sharing

When you visit our websites, we use third-party services for hosting, analytics, advertising, customer support, content acceleration, and other promotional purposes, including Google (Analytics and Ad Services), Pardot, Drift, Pendo, LinkedIn Insight Tag and others. 

The information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the circumstances described in this policy.

We also contract with third-party service providers, such as virtual hosting infrastructure providers, to host our servers and databases and to provide other services to us. It is our policy to request that our service providers agree not to access or use any information or data they may have access to while providing services to RetailNext other than as specified by us and for the purpose for which it was originally collected. In the course of sharing information if we transfer information to countries outside of the European Economic Area it is our policy that the information is transferred in accordance with this supplemental notice and as permitted by GDPR, using an available approved adequacy mechanism, including the European Commission Decision C(2010)593 Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers to Processors ("Model Clauses"). We shall remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if our service providers process information on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles unless we prove that we are not responsible in that event.

#### Data Transfer to Other Countries

Storage of this data is not always in your home country and may be transported across borders. As of the date of writing this, we store data in the United States in addition to the country in which it is collected, but we may add additional storage and processing sites without notice. When we transfer information to countries outside of the European Economic Area it is our policy that the information is transferred in accordance with this supplemental notice and using an available approved adequacy mechanism, including the Model Clauses.

Despite its invalidation, RetailNext participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

When transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States, we comply with the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability for data processed under that framework. We are also responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our behalf do the same.

We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. Visit the program's website at <http://privacyshield.gov> to learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view our certification.
