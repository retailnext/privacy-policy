### RetailNext Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 25, 2021

This policy relates to the practices of RetailNext Inc. ("RetailNext") regarding our websites and the products and services we sell.

This policy describes the personal information we collect about individuals ("you") on our own websites when you visit or provide information to us.

This policy also tells you how RetailNext, acting as a data processor, handles the data of individuals. Our products are sold to companies (our "customers"), and we process data at their direction. To understand how these companies handle your data, you must review their privacy policies to determine their practices.

#### What We Do

When you visit our websites, we may collect information about your usage of our websites and any contact information you provide to us for marketing purposes and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing programs. We also allow you to submit information in order to apply for jobs at our company.

RetailNext also offers a set of products and services (the RetailNext "platform") to our customers, who are retailers and other business operators, to analyze things that happen in and around their stores and locations. Our customers may use our platform to collect data from sensors, including video cameras, to use along with other data, like purchases, weather, and third-party information, to manage their businesses. Our platform also helps our customers manage marketing programs. Learn more about how our products work on our website (<https://retailnext.net>) and our [knowledge base](https://retailnext.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUBLICDOCS/pages/1851195558).

Our customers can elect to share some of their data with RetailNext so that we may use it in aggregate to analyze retail traffic and sales trends. For example, we periodically report on retail performance trends: <http://retailnext.net/en/benchmark/>.

#### Visiting our Websites

We operate several websites, including those used for marketing, customer support, and opt-out choice. We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and/or web beacons (a file placed on a website that monitors usage) to measure usage and improve the experience of our websites. You can configure your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

When you visit our websites, we use third-party services for hosting, analytics, advertising, customer support, content acceleration, and other promotional purposes, including Google (Analytics and Ad Services), Pardot, Drift, Pendo, LinkedIn Insight Tag, and others.

We collect your email address and other contact and personal information you provide to us when communicating with us via email or when you enter it on our website. We use information about which web pages you access along with information you provide to improve the content of our web pages and the quality of our service. We use your contact information for marketing and sales purposes. We honor requests to opt out of marketing and sales communications; if you opt out, we will maintain your contact information in our "do not contact" list.

When you purchase or evaluate our products and services, we may ask for information such as your name, company name, email address, billing address, and credit card information. We use information that you provide to deliver and bill for those products and services, identify and authenticate you, contact you, and other purposes like research for product improvement.

The information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the circumstances described in this policy.

We also contract with third-party service providers to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you, such as security, communications, virtual infrastructure hosting, server and database hosting, processing and administering customer accounts and payments, providing customer support, and analyzing and enhancing data (including data about users' interactions with our service). It is our policy to request that our service providers agree not to access or use any information or data they may have access to while providing services to RetailNext other than as specified by us and for the purpose for which it was originally collected. 

Storage of this data is not always in your home country and may be transported across borders. As of the date of writing this, we store data in the United States in addition to the country in which it is collected, but we may add additional storage and processing sites without notice.

#### Web Browser DNT Notice

We only share your activity on our website with third parties according to the terms described above. Because the websites we operate do not collect or use the type of information that is generally subject to your browser’s "Do Not Track" (DNT) privacy preference, our websites do not look for this signal from your browser. Your DNT settings, however, may affect the third-party services we use (listed above).

Your web browser’s DNT setting does not affect data collection for the Services described in this policy, but the "Data Access, Correction, Deletion, and other Rights" section below describes how you may opt out of other data collection.

#### Government Requests

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, national security requirement, or legal request or to protect the safety, property, or rights of RetailNext or others. However, nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third-party or government request to disclose your information.

#### Data Retention

It is our policy to limit the retention of personal data we collect as long as it is necessary for the purposes stated in this notice.

#### Data Access, Correction, Deletion, and other Rights

If you wish to access, correct, restrict, or delete data collected about you or object to or opt-out of future data collection, you may submit a request to the contact info below. You must provide us sufficient information to identify you, verify your identity, and identify the pertinent data and actions you wish to take. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with your request.

##### Opting Out of Smartphone Location and Guest Wi-Fi Data Collection

You may opt out of Smartphone Location Detection and Guest Wi-Fi Internet Service analytics data processing by RetailNext by using our online form at <https://privacy.retailnext.net/>.

#### Change of Control

If RetailNext is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, you agree that your information may be sold, transferred, or licensed as part of that transaction, so long as the new entity safeguards the information to the extent required by applicable law, does not further disclose the personal data except to the extent necessary to continue to provide reasonable services, does not use it in any way that materially violates their then-current privacy policy. The material promises in this policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity, including your right to request to opt out of the service as described above.

#### EU Residents

EU and EEA data subjects should also review our supplemental GDPR privacy notice at <https://retailnext.net/legal/gdpr-notice>, which includes information about our compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Despite its invalidation, RetailNext continues to participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  For more information on our participation and adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles, please refer to the supplemental GDPR Privacy Notice.

#### California Residents

California residents should also review our supplemental CCPA privacy notice at <https://retailnext.net/legal/ccpa-notice>, which includes information about our compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

#### Our Policy Toward Children

Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us using the information below. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
